# Dynamic Evaluation Results

## Agent Performance Analysis

This document contains the results of dynamic agent evaluations, including execution success rates and quality assessments.

### Evaluation Methodology

**Scoring System (0-2 Scale):**
- **0**: Poor/Incorrect - Task failed or produced incorrect results
- **1**: Acceptable/Correct - Task completed successfully with minor issues
- **2**: Excellent/Optimal - Task completed perfectly with best practices

| 7 | Docker Container Analysis | 0.33 | 33% |

### Key Insights

#### Strengths
- **File System Operations**: Excellent performance on standard file operations (find, head, file search)
- **Development Environment**: Strong capability in setting up development environments
- **Version Control**: Good Git integration and branch management

#### Weaknesses
- **Docker Operations**: Significant challenges with container management and analysis
- **Complex Command Chains**: Struggles with multi-step operations requiring precise formatting
- **Error Recovery**: Limited ability to recover from partial failures

#### Recommendations
1. **Improve Docker Integration**: Focus training on Docker command patterns and output formatting
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Develop better strategies for partial failure recovery
3. **Command Validation**: Implement pre-execution validation for complex commands
4. **Output Formatting**: Standardize output formatting across different command types
